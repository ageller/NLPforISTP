I created an OpenAI account. 

Followed installation instructions from here https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart (in a different directory)

create a conda env called openai
```
conda create --name openai python=3.10 jupyter
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Used the "playground" online to create a mock code example, copied it and modified it in the notebook.
